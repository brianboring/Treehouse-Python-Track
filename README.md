## Synopsis

The folders in this repository represent the 8 courses in the Learn Python track from Treehouse.com. I took this track over the course of about 5 months. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning Python.

## Code Example

The majority of files in this repository were written by me, with little to no cut/paste. However, Section 8_Testing are the instructors files that I downloaded and in some cases, added a bit of code to follow along on the "Testing" lesson plan. 

## Motivation

I started this Python course after going 4-5 weeks in the Harvard CS50 program. I found that I wasn't connecting with the CS50 style of learning but Treehouse was a great fit for me. I have uploaded these files here for storage, archive and reference purposes.
